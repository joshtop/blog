    <h1>March 31, 2025</h1>
    <p>this is my first ever actual post. i want this to be a marker, so i can some back to it and remember the point i was at during the part of my life. im 19, and i am currently enrolled in 
    university studying business hoping to graduate in 2026. i am an extremely driven person, but ive found that it is only under the correct circumstances. i feel as if my mind is
    darting is hundred of directions at any given moment, trying to find what the next step is, what i want to do. this degree is almost just a formality, to ensure a future. outside 
    of it, i am very secluded, mannered and simple person. i dont know what i want to do with my life, and there will always be some sort of feeling that you are lost, and that that is
    not ok, but im finding that the people that say they have a clear direction are often just as lost as you in other parts of thier lives. i have goals, and aspirations, some of which i will
    likely never achieve in my lifetime, and some of which are just ideas at this point, but i yearn to become a better, more intelligent person. i want to study physics, astronomy, different 
    languages, become more mindful, study maths, learn some coding, and more. its all about doing things on step at a time. i have a place in this world, one where i can provide value, i just
    need to keep being the best version of myself and everything will fall into place. think of that place, then go to that place, then be in that place.</p>

    <p>i do feel pressure, and i do fail, but thats ok, you just need to be honest with the people around you, and most importantly with yourself. what is working, what isnt? its ok to not know. you
    need to make mistakes, otherwise you never learn and never grow. all of this is very serface level, but sometimes you need to look back at the fundementals for the problems, the bigger picture.
    another important thing to do is to keep your promises to yourself. when you make a promise to yourself, like i am going to go the gym today, and you break it, you fail. then, you have evidence
    for failure, and your brain has no choice but to use what evidence it has to determine your reality, you cant do it. it is really only those who do whatever it is in spite of thier emotions, and
    keep those promises, that really make it. they have evidence they can do it, so thier self belief is justified, and then realized. it takes a lot of effort, but everyone is capable of it. it 
    just takes that little bit of effort everyday. make one promise, make your bed, and one you do that, add something else, making your bed and then doing 10 pushups. its the little things that add
    up and create this self belief. self belief doesnt just come out of anywhere, you need to create it from doing the things you dont want to do. once again, simple, everyone should kinda know this,
    but its good to remind myself.</p>

    <p>that should be it for now. these are just random things that were on my mind. i have other things that i may add to this blog, i may never add anything else, im not going to force it.i hope
    you enjoyed reading.</p>
